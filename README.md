# World-Explorer

World Explorer was a project that I did back in my Junior year of high school as an independent study. World explorer is an exercise in 3D game programming concepts that was developed over the course of a semester. It features texture loading, chunk systems, movement and the start of a shading algorithm as well as the start of some AI development.
